# Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Navigation Data

This project analyzes outdoor navigation data to identify patterns in navigation behavior that distinguish Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients from healthy controls. It focuses on visualizing key features and understanding their differences to gain insights into navigation impairments associated with AD.

## **1.1 Data Analysis and Visualization**

I analyzed the following features:
- **Segment Similarity**: Measures the consistency of navigation paths.
- **Entropy**: Reflects movement diversity and predictability.
- **Distance from Home**: Average distance traveled from the home location.
- **Duration of Stops**: Total time spent stationary during navigation.
- **Total Turning Angle**: Sum of all turning angles during navigation.
- **Segment Complexity**: Number of complex turns in the navigation.

### Visualizations Included:
- **Box Plots**: Display feature distributions between AD patients and healthy controls.
- **KDE Plots**: Show smooth distributions to compare feature densities.
- **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix of all numeric features.
